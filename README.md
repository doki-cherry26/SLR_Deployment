# Height vs Weight Prediction using Linear Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a simple Machine Learning application using **Linear Regression**
to predict a person's **Weight** based on their **Height**.  
The model is implemented using the **scikit-learn** library in Python.

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset (`data.csv`) contains the following columns:

- **Height** – Independent variable (feature)
- **Weight** – Dependent variable (target)

---

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

---

## 🔄 Project Workflow
1. Imported required libraries.
2. Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
3. Separated input feature (Height) and target variable (Weight).
4. Split the dataset into training and testing sets (80% training, 20% testing).
5. Created a Linear Regression model.
6. Trained the model using training data.
7. Generated predictions.
8. Evaluated model performance using **R² score**.

---

## 📊 Model Evaluation
The **R² score** is used to measure how well the model fits the data.
A higher R² value indicates better prediction accuracy.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
This project shows how Linear Regression can be used to solve a basic prediction problem.
It covers data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation in a simple and
easy-to-understand way.
